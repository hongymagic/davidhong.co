<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>
	`davidhong` is a large, flexible, and experience <code>JavaScript</code> library, framework, and code-muncher that is basically better than any others out there. Weighing in at <em>only</em> 160 pounds, there is no reason why you should look beyond <code>davidhong.js</code> for all your <code>JavaScript</code> needs.
</p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p>
	Up in the marketing department, they'll label it – “student of the web”, but I personally think it's just <em>magic</em>.
</p>
<p>
	`davidhong.js`, unlike other libraries, has a degree in computing, has enormous amount of experience in dissecting other libraries, is an active participant of <code>JavaScript</code> community such as <code>ES.next</code> mailing list as well as <code>JS Mentors`, and has participated in previous `node knockout</code> competition (2011).
</p>
<p>
	Although <code>UNIX</code> has been the primary playground for many years, <code>davidhong</code> has worked extensively with <code>.NET</code> technology. It has experiences in <code>shell</code> scripting, <code>PERL</code> and <code>C#</code> although, in the last 3 years it has primarily been <code>C#</code> and `JavaScript`. But it ain't afraid to hack up some scripts in any other language.
</p>
<p>
	The way <code>davidhong</code> works is simple: get the job done, write code that makes clients <em>and</em> developers happy and write them well.
</p>
