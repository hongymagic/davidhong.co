# What is it?

`davidhong` is a large, flexible, and experience `JavaScript` library, framework, and code-muncher that is basically better than any others out there. Weighing in at *only* 160 pounds, there is no reason why you should look beyond `davidhong.js` for all your `JavaScript` needs.

# How does it work?

Up in the marketing department, they'll label it – “student of the web”, but I personally think it's just *magic*.

`davidhong.js`, unlike other libraries, has a degree in computing, has enormous amount of experience in dissecting other libraries, is an active participant of `JavaScript` community such as `ES.next` mailing list as well as `JS Mentors`, and has participated in previous `node knockout` competition (2011).

Although `UNIX` has been the primary playground for many years, `davidhong` has worked extensively with `.NET` technology. It has experiences in `shell` scripting, `PERL` and `C#` although, in the last 3 years it has primarily been `C#` and `JavaScript`. But it ain't afraid to hack up some scripts in any other language.

The way `davidhong` works is simple: get the job done, write code that makes clients *and* developers happy and write them well.
